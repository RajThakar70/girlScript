# Introducing a new application for the security of women in the society
                    Whenever a women wants to go for a particular place this application provides whether it a decent place for them to visit or not provided she is new to the place. Here we are reviewing each and every place in deeper the visited people can agree or disagree(similar to like or dislike). According to the agree's and disagree's we will define the place which is safety for her which means if both agree's and disagree's were same in number we will define that place as normal, if agree's were more in number when compared to disagree's then it is safe place. Otherwise unsafe place.
